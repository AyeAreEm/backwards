# Backwards
Backwards is an esoteric programming language that's entirely backwards and stack based

# How it works
Python is used to parse and generate bytecode through `python bwc.py <file.bw>`

# Syntax

## Hello World
```
"dlrow olleh" tnirp
```

## Math
This adds up to 69
```
+ 53 43
```
You can imagine that the whole line gets reversed to be `34 35 +`<br>
where 34 and 35 are both put onto the stack and then pop when doing the additon, then the value is put onto the stack

# Ideas?
- Immutable variables
- Shitty type system
- Mandatory whitespace to character ratio
